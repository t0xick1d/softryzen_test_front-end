               is engaged in the development and implementation of renewable environmentally
               friendly energy sources. We are the first privately owned company that received a
               loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and built the
               first wind farm in Western Ukraine. During the company's work, a number of projects
               in the field of energy were implemented. At the same time, new investment projects,
               in particular small hydropower and biofuels, are constantly being developed and
               developed with existing objects.
